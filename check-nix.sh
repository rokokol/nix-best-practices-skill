check-nix.sh — holds Nix sources to what the formatter cannot check

nixfmt owns layout. statix owns the language's antipatterns. deadnix owns dead code.
This checker calls those three and adds only what none of them can see: the shape of a
module header, the scope a `with` opens, whether a derivation carries a meta, and whether
the lock names a path that exists on one machine alone.
Every run proves each check able to fail. It plants one defect into a canonical file and
requires the rejection. A copy therefore falsifies itself wherever it runs.
Nothing here is repository-specific, and this belongs in a repository's own gate

  check-nix.sh [-C DIR] [-N NAMESPACE]... [--static] [PATH...]
  check-nix.sh --template [module|package|flake]
  check-nix.sh --list-rules

  -C DIR       the repository root. It defaults to the git toplevel of the working
               directory, else to that directory. flake.nix and flake.lock live here
  -N NAMESPACE a prefix this repository declares its own options under, such as rokokol
               or programs.screen-shader. Repeatable. A repository that declares options
               and names none of these is told so, rather than passed
  PATH...      check these files instead of every .nix file under DIR. The flake and lock
               rules then run only when flake.nix is among them
  --static     run only what reads files, and nothing that evaluates the flake. It exists
               for the nix flake check sandbox, which has no network and no store. The
               summary then says the evaluated half did not run. Nothing chooses this
               flag on its own: a missing tool is a refusal, not a quiet pass
  --template   print a canonical module, package or flake and exit
  --list-rules print every rule with its tier and mechanism, and exit

Environment: CHECK_NIX_NESTED=1 runs the checks and skips the self-test. A gate that calls
this more than once uses it, so one copy is not proven twice. CHECK_NIX_GOLDEN, set to
anything, makes the pinned shape of the parser's output deliberately wrong. The self-test
uses it to prove the refusal that shape is pinned by
Nothing here reaches the network
Exit 0 when clean. Exit 1 with one `check-nix: <what>` line per finding. Exit 2 on a usage
error, an unreadable path, a missing tool, a moved tool output, or nothing to check
